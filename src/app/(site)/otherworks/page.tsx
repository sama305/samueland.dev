      <p>Welcome to my garden. In here, you'll find miscellaneous projects that don't quite fit into the main pages, but are interesting enough to warrant being shared.</p>
      <p>My aim is to cultivate and share my interests in a more organic way than a conventional navbar allows; this vertical, nested navbar allows for the garden to grow as needed without imposing on the main pages of the site.</p>
      <p>If there was one part of this site where I think someone could get a complete picture of who I was as a person, it would be here. I hope that you find something in this collection that makes you as happy all of them made me.</p>
