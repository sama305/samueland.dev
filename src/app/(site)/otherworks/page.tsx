      <p>Welcome to my garden. In here, we lose the structured safety of the main pages, while gaining a far broader variety of content to view. My aim is to cultivate and share my interests in a more organic way than a conventional navbar allows; the vertical, nested nature of navigation allows for the garden to grow as needed without imposing on the other, more professionally important pages of the site.</p>
      <p>If there was one part of this site where I think someone could get a complete picture of who I was as a person, it would be here. I hope that you find something in this collection that makes you as happy all of them made me.</p>
