        <p>I think <strong>writing</strong> is for everyone and that everyone should be a writer. Not necessarily in the sense of a profession (though, if you can, you should do that), but as a part of your lifestyle.</p>
        <p>As human beings, we are using our brains all day, every day; naturally, we often get inundated with difficult to understand thoughts and thus need some way to deal with them. Writing gives you the ability to record these thoughts and work them through in reality, rather than in your head.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Once you get good at writing, not only do your ideas become more understandable to you and others, but you can begin to play with it and create art. Much writing (such as <a href="/library/writing/poetry">poetry</a> and songwriting) still conveys complex ideas while also providing artistic value. It is much more fun to work your problems out in a <i>song</i> than an <i>essay</i></p>
        <h2>Free writing</h2>
        <p><b>Free writing</b> is a method of writing exercise whereby the practitioner writes for a certain amount of time without stopping. This means you may just have to write whatever comes to your head: what you had for breakfast, what you read yesterday, how you feel about the weather. There are no rules besides <i>keep writing</i>.</p>
        <p>Often (especially in classroom settings), one or more prompts are also provided, which you are supposed to integrate into your piece. This adds another layer of difficulty, where you can't stop writing and must write about something specific.</p>
        <p>I first discovered free writing in an introductory literature class, and I it so helpful that I decided to make a small free writing web app called <a href="https://librewrite.com">Librewrite</a>. It gives you all the tools you need to practice writing while also being completely free to use. Additionally, your pieces are stored locally, so you can write <i>as much as you want</i>.</p>
