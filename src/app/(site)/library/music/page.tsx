      <article>
        <p>Out of every art, <strong>music</strong> may be the most universal. Unlike most art forms, which are restricted to humans (such as <SamLink href="/library/writing">writing</SamLink>) or require deliberate practice (like painting), music is an art practiced not just by humans, not just by the animal kingdom, not even just practiced by living things, but potentially <em>everything in the universe</em>.</p>
        <p>Though it is important to clarify that <em>sound</em> and by extension <em>music</em> are the result of our ears receiving <SamLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_wave">acoustic waves</SamLink> and our brains perceiving it, so though all things <em>produce</em> music, not all things (not even all animals) necessarily <em>consume</em> music. But that all things are artists, to me, remains an interesting feat.</p>

        <h2>Songwriting</h2>

        <p>One of my main hobbies these days is <strong>songwriting</strong>: crafting lyrics and tunes and combining them to create full songs. I have always played guitar and piano and enjoyed making small tunes, but I only started songwriting perhaps one year ago.</p>
        <p>Nervousness about my voice, about my lyrics, and about the difficulty of making music always made me avoid it; but once I  sat down, strummed some chords and wrote a few lyrics to go with them, I realized my fear was unfounded and it wasn't as scary as I had thought.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, I try to write all the time: in the morning, when I get back from work, and especially on the weekends. I've probably written over 50 songs, a few of which I've actually managed to record and mix.</p>
        <p>For the record, I am not a gear junkie: I use GarageBand as my DAW, a Blue Yeti for vocals and acoustic guitar, a small, unromantic $50 audio interface for electric guitar.</p>

        <h3>Influences</h3>

        <p>Though I listen to a great deal of music (as you may read below), my songwriting is inspired by a few artists in particular.</p>
        <p>The structure of my songs owes a great deal to the Beatles. Their verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus framework just works so well and I find myself using it a lot.</p>
        <p>The chords I often use depend on the instrument: on guitar, I tend to follow Neil Young songs and use G, C, Am, D, Em, etc. sometimes in 12-bar blues but also just following his general sound; on piano I find myself playing like Laura Nyro, Carole King, and Todd Rundgren, which means I use a lot of major 7 chords and slash chords.</p>
        <p>Finally, for the actual lyrics I once again look towards Neil. His economical use of words and simplicity have always had a draw for me and I try my best to put my thoughts plainly and memorably, just as he does.</p>

        <h2>My music taste</h2>

        <p>Though my songwriting journey began recently, I have pretty much always been an avid music listener and explorer. I enjoy a variety of genres, but I tend to find myself coming back to folk and all the permutations of rock. Additionally, most of the rock I listen to is from the 60s, 70s, and 90s. This wasn't a conscious decision; these decades tend to pique my interest more than others, so I listen to them the most.</p>

        <h3>Folk and rock</h3>

        <p>My favorite artists of these style are Neil Young, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, to name a few. Neil and Bob are probably my all time most listened to artists, though I've been listening to the Beatles and Beach Boys since high school so perhaps they are higher.</p>
        <p>Even though they are by far my most listened to genres of music, I really don't have too much to say about them. For me, these genres just feel natural, like they've always been there and are the natural progression of music as it ebbs through history.</p>
        <p>Of these artists, many of their albums are tattooed in my brain and are always humming in its silence: <em>Pet Sounds</em> by the Beach Boys; <em>Rubber Soul</em> and honestly every Beatles album after; <em>Blood on the Tracks</em> and all of Dylan's 60s output; all of Neil's albums up to and including <em>Rust Never Sleeps</em>; David Bowie's Berlin trilogy; much of Paul McCartney's solo career; some of Lennon's solo career; Todd Rundgren's two great albums <em>Something/Anything</em> and <em>Wizard</em>; the list goes on and on.</p>

        <h3>Brazilian music &amp; MPB</h3>

        <p>Listening to lo-fi hip hop in high school planted an interesting seed in my music taste which first led to bossa nova and subsequently MPB, samba, etc.</p>
        <p>Besides the U.S., the U.K., and perhaps Canada, I think Brazil has had some of the best music ever produced, especially in the 60s and 70s.</p>
        <p>Lô Borges as well as Milton Nascimento both separately and together made some of the best rock/pop of those decades (with the creative peak being Clube da Esquina); Novos Baianos have an incredible album I find myself going back to all the time, i.e. Acabou Chorare; Jorge Ben Jor is always a fantastic listen, as is Gilberto Gil and so many more. I can't forget of course the great Antônio Carlos Jobim, and so many others. The amount of talent from the country is staggering.</p>
        <p>One interesting note about this genre: I can't understand the lyrics at all. I am hispanic and can speak some Spanish, but I know absolutely zero Portugese. Sure, after studying a line for a bit and perhaps through context clues I can get a vague idea of the meaning (<i>você</i> for instance means "you"), but for the vast majority of songs I just take it in without understanding.</p>
        <p>In that way, I find listening to Brazilian music to be pure experience: I am listening to it solely for the music and nothing more; no lyrics can taint the beautiful chords samba and bossa.</p></article>
