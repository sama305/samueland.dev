        <p><strong>Idealism </strong> encompassses many different ideas but the basic premise is that the observable universe exists as a construct within our mind; reality as we know it simply exists as ideas.</p>
        <h2>Plato</h2>
        <p>Plato is perhaps the most famous idealist. He came up with the concept of <em>Forms</em>: the idea that all that we observe are only shadows or imperfect renditions of timeless, abstract, perfect Forms that exist outside our physical reality and even our own minds.</p>
        <h3>Allegory of the Cave</h3>
        <p>To explain this, he used the <em>Allegory of the Cave</em>. In this allegory, a group of people are chained within a cave, forced to look at shadows on the wall. They see all kinds of people and animals walking by, and mistake these shadows for reality. Eventually, one of the prisoners breaks free and escapes the cave. He sees reality as it actually was (i.e. Forms) and realizes the shadows were imperfect representations. He returns to the cave to try and rescue his fellow prisoners, but they don&#x27;t believe him and even threaten to kill him.</p>
