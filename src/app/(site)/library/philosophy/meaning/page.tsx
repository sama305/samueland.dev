        <p>In the past, when the question of the <strong>meaning</strong> has come up, I've always felt I was kidding myself. Given my age and lack of life experience, how could I possibly know?</p>
        <p>Not only that, even if I <i>thought</i> I knew what the meaning of life was, how could I be sure enough to declare it? As a result, I've given up trying to answer this question; there's no guarantee of a meaning, and if there is, there's no guarantee its knowable. And let's just say for a moment it is both real and knowable: is it even worth knowing? It's more trouble than its worth, in my opinion.</p>
        <p>Camus believed the universe was inherently meaningless; Hesse believed that the meaning of life was self-realization. Though these are conflicting ideas, I find myself grasping at both of them.</p>
        <p>Meaning isn't a simple enough question where one can fully submerge themselves into one bucket of thought; our own opinions and ideas are collages of those we find in the wild.</p>
