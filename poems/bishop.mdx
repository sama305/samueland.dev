title: "Death of the Bishop"
date: "June 2025"

In this old year of 1883<br/>
A bishop has passed<br/>
In his old Sante Fe community<br/>

The first of his kind<br/>
To run these empty hills of sand<br/>
To bring god to a godless plain<br/>
With his previous self left in the Old Land<br/>

Take heed, of this noted death<br/>
His community lies on the ground<br/>
Waiting for a sign from above<br/>
Waiting for a heavenly sound<br/>

Though many may not know his name<br/>
And many never will<br/>
He rocked the earth where he stood<br/>
And people talk of him still<br/>

A crater he left here<br/>
Which never will erode<br/>
Though one cannot see it from space<br/>
Round here it’s all that’s knowed<br/>

Brown and yellow and white<br/>
all held their hands<br/>
And solemnly hummed<br/>
as friends took the stand<br/>
And brought to life<br/>
this dead missionary<br/>
Brought him back once more<br/>
Again out of history<br/>

He came in a long ago time<br/>
where not much stood here at all<br/>
Except natives and their land<br/>
who together stood proudly tall<br/>

They liked his love<br/>
They liked his kindness too<br/>
He showed love to all<br/>
Especially to those he knew<br/>

So let’s behind Bishop Latour<br/>
A model for a man, and so much more<br/>
He is as we all should be<br/>
Under this mighty spirit<br/>
Let’s be all we will ever be<br/>
Lest we will not will it<br/>
