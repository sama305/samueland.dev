Ah, to be a vagrant,<br/>
Always dancing in the sun.<br/>
I'd live each day in peace,<br/>
And every single day I'd run,<br/>

Through quiet fields,<br/>
Brimming with infernal daisies,<br/>
Yellow petals in my toes,<br/>
And the wind always changing.<br/>

Towards my home it blows,<br/>
See, I live right here,<br/>
Right where you're standing,<br/>
My home is always near.<br/>

But instead I drown in paperwork,<br/>
And coarse documents cut my skin.<br/>
I'd prefer a warm neck of red,<br/>
And to sleep with a face full of grin,<br/>

Yes, resting under the shade of an oak,<br/>
While all time passes by,<br/>
And leaves me in my little spot,<br/>
Where to this very day I shall lie.<br/>
