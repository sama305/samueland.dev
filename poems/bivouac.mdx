Walking, crossing the flat plains<br/>
The checkered clouds warp across the wild skies<br/>
I feel confident when I’m saddled<br/>
My gun is tapered to my side<br/>
The wispy sand settles behind<br/>
Hooves beating into the hollow earth<br/>

Bivouacking nights away, restless mornings of coffee<br/>
Ah, those slow, cold mornings of hard stone and sodden fires<br/>
The suns gaze only ceases in the dank, beer-smelling rooms that hold our souls apart<br/>
The booming rhythm of whisky and beers, slumping towards lost meadows<br/>
All victimized by chemical reactions and slow nights<br/>

My tired horse trotting on through the balky crags and weeping pines<br/>
Leads through soulish, encumbering woods<br/>
His poisoning heart hugging the dirt<br/>
There’s mud on my old boots<br/>
In an instant all pain, expelled<br/>
Leather carrying me, I journey on to conquer the sun<br/>
