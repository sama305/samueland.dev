Upon failing,<br/>
Not a single being twitched,<br/>
The grass kept wagging and dancing in the wind,<br/>
The sun never ceased spilling its light all over the trees,<br/>
The air never stopped bristling our hairs,<br/>
The ground never stopped humming,<br/>
The creatures never stopped purring,<br/>
The lovers didn't stop murmuring,<br/>
The sky never stopped painting,<br/>
Its flourishes of clouds on its great blue canvas.<br/>

Flitting my eyes to each passerby,<br/>
They were ignorant of my existence let alone my failures,<br/>
They were engaged in conversation,<br/>
They were focusing on their footsteps,<br/>
They were breathing the cool, blue air,<br/>
They were sighing and weeping,<br/>
They were living without my failures even a component,<br/>
Not even a factor of their own lives.<br/>

In fact, the only thing that glances toward this failure,<br/>
Is the single item of the universe for which control can be exerted,<br/>
It is the most powerful yet oppressive,<br/>
Most brilliant yet doubting,<br/>
Most capable yet despondent,<br/>
Most impactful yet frail,<br/>
It both moves one and keeps one standing in place.<br/>

So, upon realizing this,<br/>
I smiled and watched the world go by,<br/>
I watched the squirrels scurry to their homes,<br/>
I watched the slanting light hit the towers of bricks,<br/>
I watched the trees reaching out towards the firmament,<br/>
I watched buses and cars hum along,<br/>
The bees bounce between flowertops,<br/>
The drinkers drink their ichor,<br/>
The birds tear the sky with their wings,<br/>
The flags scream in the wind,<br/>
The heels of well-dressed women click,<br/>
The chairs of restless student squeak,<br/>
The jeering of good sport fly,<br/>
The humble silence of a peaceful man,<br/>
And I realized,<br/>
How inconsequential I was,<br/>
And again I broadly smiled.<br/>
