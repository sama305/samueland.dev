WHAT time the meanest brick and stone<br/>
Take on a beauty not their own,<br/>
And past the flaw of builded wood<br/>
Shines the intention whole and good,<br/>
And all the little homes of man<br/>
Rise to a dimmer, nobler span;<br/>
When colour's absence gives escape<br/>
To the deeper spirit of the shape,<br/>

-- Then earth's great architecture swells<br/>
Among her mountains and her fells<br/>
Under the moon to amplitude<br/>
Massive and primitive and rude:<br/>

-- Then do the clouds like silver flags<br/>
Stream out above the tattered crags,<br/>
And black and silver all the coast<br/>
Marshalls its hunched and rocky host,<br/>
And headlands striding sombrely<br/>
Buttress the land against the sea,<br/>
-- The darkened land, the brightening wave --<br/>
And moonlight slants through Merlin's cave. <br/>
