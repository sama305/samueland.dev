The twinkle from your eyes<br/>
Casts a shadow on the wall<br/>
Velvet blue that darkens<br/>
Melts away it all<br/>
A mesh of seaborn colors<br/>
Only strikes the hue<br/>
Seabirds favorite color<br/>
I think it might be you<br/>

Red from the sky<br/>
And green from your heart<br/>
Dusk hits my mind and soul<br/>
And breaks it all apart<br/>
But what might be the beauty<br/>
Without a love most dear<br/>
A love of many colors<br/>
A small kiss on the ear<br/>

Gone are the days of golden dawns<br/>
Gone are the nights of sleep<br/>
Without your love in color<br/>
I cannot think, I cannot be<br/>
