I hear the shrieks, across the swamps<br/>
It bellows through the winds<br/>
A mother’s cry, a father’s heed,<br/>
A brother’s familiar grin<br/>

You say you never needed aid<br/>
But I don’t see it close behind<br/>
Ill go, I said, with tired eyes, I said I’m going back home<br/>

The weight is heavy, across my chest<br/>
Sometimes I can’t even breathe<br/>
I can see a chain, between my legs,<br/>
Linked to their hard knees<br/>

You say that it won’t be the same<br/>
But I’ve seen it all before<br/>
Ill go, I said, with tired feet, I said I’m going back home<br/>
