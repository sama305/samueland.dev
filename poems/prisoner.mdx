The great cellar door, ruinous and torn<br/>
Locks me in with spells which glow and warm.
Through brass bars out to the open sea,
And ships landing sandy foam spills like tea<br/>

Hands strewn out, the maids keep me up<br/>
Keep me fed, always full my cup<br/>
But soon I will escape through shadows and dirt<br/>
And cast upon this town the same spells which hurt<br/>
