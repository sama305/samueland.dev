title: "To Die"
date: "June 2025"

In my darkest days,<br/>
Where the shadows were long and cold,<br/>
And the cellars rang with mysterious mists,<br/>
And not from the sky did come any lights of gold,<br/>
Where the mountains sang omens of death,<br/>
And skies quickly passed by,<br/>
I felt in those moments I thought that I might die
