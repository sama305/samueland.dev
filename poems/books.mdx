When I am surrounded by books, I am not yet at peace.<br/>
Only when my whole body and soul is encompassed by a book, I am at peace.<br/>

As I turn the shy, yellowed pages and the inked words glow and manifest into a fully realized world outside my body and outside its own vessel, my soul and mind relax and enter a state of peace.<br/>

The daily stresses and nail biting consequences brought on by listlessness and indecision are brought to rest with these trunks of literary glory. One can feel their heart slow, their blood settle, their mind ease while reading and entering a book.<br/>

Books have a similar power to nature to completely engulf a person in peace, to totally immerse the body in a cool, mysterious ichor.<br/>

When trampling down the dells of life, books can act as steps to lead you up and away, to the greenest and brightest of hills. Above the rushing canopies and lazy clouds, out to the shy cosmos, and out into the heavens.<br/>
