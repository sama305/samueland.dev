Yellow fever kicking hard<br/>
Floating down so fast<br/>
Floating through the Ganges with no plans but my hat<br/>

It was a lonely nighttime<br/>
With stars as my company<br/>
I hid under the motherless<br/>
Shadow of a tree<br/>

And when the ranger saw me<br/>
He sounded off the bells<br/>
He seemed so tense and angry<br/>
But ‘Twas him who cast the spell<br/>

When I see any ranger now<br/>
I clutch my heart inside<br/>
I fear for life round towers<br/>
It’s there I don’t feel well<br/>

But now and then those paths I walk<br/>
Have unknown souls to meet<br/>
I’m not scared once I talk to one<br/>
Honestly I think they fear me.

So on I go through the perilous cities<br/>
Of lost diseases and beasts<br/>
Maybe one day I’ll settle down<br/>
Or maybe my home I’ll never meet.
