Through my gazing portal<br/>
Distant flashes of light<br/>
The foggy billows of mist<br/>
Which are struck as mortal<br/>
Unceasing and godly powerful<br/>
These trinkets of death from a dooming playwright<br/>
Strewn across the stretches of the purple sky<br/>

Deathly by nature, incredible by observation<br/>
What dangerous beauty granted as such<br/>
Never ceasing to transform fear to awe<br/>
Where flame and power come to draw blood from the clouds<br/>
