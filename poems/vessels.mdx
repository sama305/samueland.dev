We spent a cold little evening in arms<br/>
Spread like apples on the long couch<br/>
Talking of times we spent<br/>
With warm wine in our mouths<br/>

Eventually we reached ourselves<br/>
And how we found each other long ago<br/>
Why we stayed in arms<br/>
And together we prayed<br/>

We were so young those days<br/>
We had no idea<br/>
Of the mountains weâ€™d climb<br/>
And the journey between us<br/>

But just as things are<br/>
it was soon meant to be<br/>
Because alas I did not find you,
you did not find me<br/>

Instead our hearts collected<br/>
And formed one lovely company<br/>
And from this being we came out<br/>
New and fresh and very free<br/>
