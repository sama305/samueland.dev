Collecting my belongings<br/>
All sitting on the floor<br/>
They all sat so quietly<br/>
Waiting by the door<br/>

A guest came up so mad<br/>
He spoke he angrily<br/>
He couldn’t understand the place<br/>
He was supposed to be<br/>

And now I have to go<br/>
Round the bricked corner<br/>
Because someone didn’t know<br/>
There childhood manners<br/>

Before I left the place<br/>
I dropped a letter smoothly<br/>
It stated all that I wanted to state<br/>
And it did so duly.
