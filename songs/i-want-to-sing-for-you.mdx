                   E
I want to sing for you
             A
Every single night and day
            E
It'll be so true
         B7
In every single way
           E 
We'll be together
                A
All through the night
       E
Baby I love you
    A    B7    E
Our love is alright

                E
Do you know the time?
           A
The sky is so dark
         E
And everyones
              B7
Home in their warm socks
               E
I think what I need
               A
Is a cool cool pillow
       E
Baby I love you
    A    B7    E
Our love is so mellow


B7
I can't wait for you and me
   A
To buy our own little home
    B7
The darkest days are past us now
   A                    E
So let's just enjoy the moment
