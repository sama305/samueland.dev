C Fmaj7 x 2


C                                  Fmaj7
Sometimes I wish we could still be friends
    C                              Fmaj7
But right now its a whole lot easier to pretend


Am Fmaj7 x 2


Images are passing through my mind
Of times and places that we’ve left behind

When you left, it caught me from behind
But I should seen the trail I’d left beside

Am            F
I’m always missing you
Am                        G
    I don’t know what ill do
    F    
Without you


    C       Fmaj7
Without you
    C       Fmaj7
Without you


I wish I could capture us in time
When things were simple, when there was nothing on the line


Am Fmaj7 x 2


Sometimes I hear your voice real late at night
You’re not there, but your presence makes me feel alright


I’m always missing you
I don’t know what Ill do
Without you

Without you
Without you
```
