E
I
   A
Am looking
    F#m
For meaning

E
When
   A
It was
    F#m
The evening


G#m           F#m
   You are my star
E             A       D       A
Splitting the sky for far too long
G#m           F#m
   You are my love
      F
And I think you know
                 E
What im thinking of


<instrumental E-A-F#m like verses>


E
Time
     A
Just keeps on
   F#m
On reeling

A
Why
   A
Do all things
      F#m
Break even


G#m           F#m
   You are my star
E             A       D       A
Splitting the sky for far too long
G#m           F#m
   You are my love
      F
And I think you know
                 E
What im thinking of
