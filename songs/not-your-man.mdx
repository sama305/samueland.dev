G       E7
I don’t mind
A7        D7         G        E7
   If you love me or not, I’m tryin
A7             D7   G          E7
   To make you understand, I’m fine
A7          D7       G    D7-G
   Cause im not your man

We’re no good
Our situation is misunderstood
I think that’s it well and good
If im not your man


    B7
But if I was
               E
I’d buy you anything
    A7                               D  b7
I’d Get you all that you might ever dream


Its alright
I really like you but youre not my type
It’ll be better if I take a flight
Cause ill never be your man

But maybe soon
We can try it out and see for sure
We can do it so mature
And maybe ill be your man


But if I was
I’d buy you anything
I’d Get you all that you might ever dream

E
