Everybody’s got their things they do in the dark
I know I got many things to fear in my heart
I just want to make you mine my love
And in the dark there’s no one else im thinking of

You got your own problems don’t you baby
Ones That can’t be fixed by books or limousines
Im also figuring life out myself baby
But I try to hurt those in the wind

With just a moment you can smile aloud
But is all that’s left all worthwhile?   

Im all in the darknesss now baby
I can’t see anything but now im free
You may find yourself someday baby 
If you do I hope you think of why youre here

With just a moment you can smile aloud
But is all that’s left all worthwhile?
