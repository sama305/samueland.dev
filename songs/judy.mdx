I     have dreams of you,

Judy
    D G
And I    was missing you
Dmaj7  F#m7 Em7 Gmaj
truly

Cmaj7 A7             D    Gmaj D
And      your pretty hair
Cmaj7       A7             G    A
When we were at the county fair


D Em7 F#m7 Em7


You were sweet to me,
Judy
And I treated you so
rudely

I forgot your pretty eyes
Kissing me with a soft disguise


Bm7  Em7          A          Dmaj7
Judy why, did you cry, every time
Bm7                Em7             A              Dmaj7
   You closed your eyes, you would cry, you would cry

Bm7        Em7             A            Dmaj7
I tried to lie, I tried to lie, but you cried
Bm7        Em7         A   Dmaj7
  And now I, wish that I   took my time


I remember when,
Judy
When all the days were just you-
and me

You were all I wanted then
But I know that all was already said


Judy why, did you cry, every time
You closed your eyes, you would cry, you would cry

I tried to lie, I tried to lie, but you cried
And now I, wish that I didn’t take my time
