          C
I’ve been working real hard
        Fmaj7
Like an old fashioned bard
G
Writing all these songs
      Fmaj7
Every day
	
Working on a ship
Where I call myself the skip
Sailing on winedark sea
On windy days

Laying out these tunes
Walking through the dunes
Throwing all my sounds
Into waves

Setting it all down
When nobody’s around
Setting all my feelings
Upon the ground


Cmaj7
   I’ll come back again
C7
   Sometime later on
F          Fm                  C /B Am /G F
   Darling,   don't be so very long


Its everything to me
Its all I want to be
And all that I am
In the morning

A ladder from the pain
Shelter from the rain
Riding far away
From the wings of a beast

I’ll come back again
Sometime later on
Darling, will you be long
Don’t be too long
Darling will you be long
```
