G
Sometimes
       Am
When I think about
F                        G
   All the good Times we had

I can’t help
Dream about
Living in the past


Am                         C
Why are all the visions so blue?
Am                                 C
I think it might have something to do
     G
With you


Now were both
Own our own
With no hands to hold

I wish you
Knew much I
Truly loved you still


Am                         C
Why are all the visions so blue?
Am                                 C
I think it might have something to do
     G
With you


G    D        Am    C
Everything is blue
G        D           Am   C
Even the memories of you
        G             D     Am                C
There’s nothing I can do, I can’t keep loving you
G      D             Am    C
Why is everything so blue


I don’t like
To think about
You going on your way

There’s nothing I
can do about it
There’s no other way


Am                         C
Why are all the visions so blue?
Am                                 C
I think it might have something to do
     G
With you


G    D        Am    C
Everything is blue
G        D           Am   C
Even the memories of you
        G             D     Am                C
There’s nothing I can do, I can’t keep loving you
G      D             Am    C
Why is everything so blue
