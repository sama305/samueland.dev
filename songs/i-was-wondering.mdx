```
G
I was wondering
                       C
Did you called me that day
       D
Was it you in the wilderness
          C       G
Or was it someone else

I was meaning to ask you
Was that your light that I saw
going down last Sunday
Going down memory lane

D         C
I’ve been unfolding
D             Am
Why can’t you see
D          C
How simple life
      Bm7  Am  D
Could be-e-e-e


I was pondering
If your life and mine
Were meant to be twisted
And held over the wire

Over the wall There’s
someone new
They don’t know or beseech me
But maybe they can clue


I’ve been unfolding
Why can’t you see
How simple life
Could be
Yeah

```
