Capo 3rd fret

C                F       C
   Early morning coffee
C        C/B    Am
Dropping mom at work
F                 G
   I have the car all day
F            G                  C
   We can go anywhere you want


C                   F       C
   Not touching the handles
C        C/B    Am
For even just a second
F              G
   Morning air feels nice
F                    G            C
   It comes from the early ocean


C                 F      C
   Coming back so heavy
C         C/B Am
It’s only 9 o clock

   We have the whole day to spend it
F                G        C
   Let’s eat and leave at once


C                 F         C
   I’m going on a bike ride
C      C/B     Am
In the morning sky
F                    G
   The day starts so beautiful
F                 G         C
   I hope it will stay this nice
