Again, no chorus. But I like the lyrics.

```
D Am C G

D Am C G Am

D
I was searching
    Am
For one gold ring
       C              G
I have known it in my dreams
D
On the hand
     Am
Of a fair young girl
      C
Whose name
  G         Am
I could not see


It had power
Like a fiery stone
And could bring my 
Inner peace

It’s wearer would
Cascade and fall
But know the truth
Would he


I had gone
A thousand miles
Before I had heard
her sing 

She was in a
Magic cave
Wearing her
Golden ring


When her shadow
Hit the floor
I saw thr
Brightest eyes

I had ever
Gazed before 
And in their souls
There was surprise


It was many
years ago
When I had found
the cave

I won’t ever
forget her smile
Or the way her hair
Would sway


The ring was all
I wanted then
And was all I ever
Dreamed

But really what I
Needed then
Was a girl whose love
I’d breathed
```
