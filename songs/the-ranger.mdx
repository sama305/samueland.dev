  G
A man who was a ranger

He came from sante fe
   C                                         G
He served the law till it came to an end one day
   Am               D
He pulled up on the wrong man
        Am              D
And the wrong man had a gun
       Em
And he shot him
       D
In the Sun
       Am
Yes he shot him
       G
In the Sun


     G
That savage Sun it beat

Upon his shiny head
C
Sweat Like a tin roof in the summer, he shed
    Am            D
Now he was on the run
         Am          D
And with no where to go
       Em
In the desert
        D
With no hope
       Am
In the desert
        G
With no hope


     G
Once night had fell he lost

Any semblance of a plan
   C
He reached out into the darkness for a prayer
    Am               D
And soon a light had shown
    Am              D
And one more to the right
      Em
And a siren
       D
In the night
       Am
Twas a siren
       G
In the night


    G
Now in a box he sits

And weeps every single day
          C
About his crime when never needed to be
    Am             D
And one day he may find
  Am           D
A peace in his heart
        Em
But for now he’s
       D
In the dark
    Am
For now he’s
       G
In the dark
```
