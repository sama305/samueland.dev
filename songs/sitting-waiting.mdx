I can’t wait forever, no, my baby
But ill sit right here for you just in case
Please come free me from this comfy prison
And bring coffee too, if you can


Am          D      G        C
   How much longer   will I wait
Am                       D      G       C
   I don’t know how much longer   I can take
Am           D
