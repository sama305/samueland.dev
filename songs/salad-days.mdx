```
D           A
   Drinking wine
     G
On a Monday night
D           A          G
  There was nothing on today

Eating cereal
By the kitchen light
Didn’t feel like cooking today


D A G x 2


In these mornings
When the sun’s so bright
Its such a special time

Sleeping on the
couch last night
I wouldnt want it any other way

Bm7               C
   Every day will color the past
G
   And every moment fades away
Bm7                         A
    I try and remember to enjoy these little things
      G                              A
Cause ill be doing less than nothing one day


Drinking wine
On a Monday night
There was nothing on today

Eating cereal
By the kitchen light
Didn’t feel like cooking today


Every day will color the past
And every moment fades away
I try and remember to enjoy these little things 
Cause ill be doing less than nothing one day
