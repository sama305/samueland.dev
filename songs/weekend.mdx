Capo 1st fret

                     Am       D
I can’t wait for the weekend
                     G
No it can’t come too soon
                       Am    D
Cause when I’m in this city
                          G
I can’t help but think of you
                   Am      D
I saw you inside a forest
                           G
With yellow leaves in your hair
                      Am      D
You asked me if I was honest
                      G
But the answer didn’t matter


                 Am    D
I can’t have you back
                     Em   G
It doesn’t work that way
                  Am    D
You’re not coming back
          G
Until I’m away


               Am       D
Every moment I remember
                    G
I can’t ever let it go
                        Am         D
When two people make an agreement
                   G
You have to really know
                       Am       D
So we're sailing out together
               G
But only in my mind
                  Am            D
Things are always better there
                   G
That's just what i find


                 Am    D
I can’t have you back
                     Em   G
It doesn’t work that way
                  Am    D
You’re not coming back
          Gmaj7
Until I’m away
