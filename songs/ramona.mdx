Well they say
   A6
Oh ramona
        Em7
I’m not sure
          A6
What they told ya
        Em
So I’ll go
      G
In my car
          A
And drive away

Em7
Hot
       A6
Like a summer
     Em7
In a car
             A6
Far from the winter
         Em7
Well its time
          G
For me to go
       A
So far away

   You always know just what to do
F   Em

   When will I rid myself of you


         Em
Well goodbye
A6
This Time its done
And now you’re gone
My Ramona
And you walked
To my cell
And threw a smile


C     Em
Ooh ramona
C                               Em
   You always know just what to do

   When will I rid myself of you
