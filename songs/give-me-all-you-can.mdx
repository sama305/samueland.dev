```
D
Give me all you got
Em
I know you got lots
F#m7
Give me all you can
Em
You know im your man

I got nothing to say
You already made my day
I can’t help but smile
Please come stay awhile

Everybody knows
You don’t even got to show
Lets go walk a mile
You’ve got a sense of style

I know what to do
Everything goes through you
Its all clear to me now
And you can come and tell me how


Dmaj7                     Em7
If you take a chance with me
F#m7                    Em7
   I think ill make you happy
Dmaj7                     Em7
I don’t know how long ill be
F#m7                           Em7
But I know that with you I can see


(instrumental verse)


G                            D
I’ve been going steady for a week or two
A         G           D
Holding myself to the line
G                            Bm
I can’t give away even for a moment, you
A              G            D
   Or else ill throw it all away


If you take a chance with me
I think ill make you happy
I don’t know how long ill be
But I know that with you I can see
```
