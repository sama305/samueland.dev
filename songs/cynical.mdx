G                 E7
You act so cynically
        A7
I can’t count all the times
            D7
You woke me up in black of night

I’m just saying typically
Its a doozy just to dance
I’ll get you home, please understand

B7                            E
   I hope that you can see me through
         A7                     D-B7
You just got to have a good attitude 


I talk so superficially
When I say you do no wrong
You’ve done me before, where do I start

Im no better naturally
I know im no fine gem
But I still try to stay out of the pen


I hope that you can see me through
You just got to have a good attitude
