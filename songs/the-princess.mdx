A
Ocean swelling
Em
Moonlight is fading
G             D
Minute by the hour
    A
The coastline is as
Em
Far as I'm gazing
G     C       D
I can see the tower

A
Scraping clouds
     Em
They doom in the distance
G         D
Images of stone
    A
The ancients never
Em
Knew it could do this
G       C       D
But its come to show

A
Walls of ivy
Em
Line every brick
    G               D
And grow upon their walls
A
At the top
  Em
I saw a bright light
         G         C         D
And then lost everything I'd known


    G               D
But baby I’m coming home
      G            C            D       
To my princess, my tower and my throne
Bbmaj7       Am
Sweeping the floor
           Gm7
You’re the one I Adore
Bbmaj7       Am
Yes babe its true
    Gm7
All I want is you
G
Ahhh


A
You were princess
  Em
A Queen in the making
G           D
Ruling everyone
A
You had eyes like
Em
Flames of an amber
G      C     D
I felt I had won

A
When your hands
    Em
And mine met each other
G               D
Life felt oh so right
A
That was before
    Em
The end of it all
     G            C         D
When things still seemed so bright

A
Whispered forests
Em
Weeped when I lost you
G                         D
They shed all their green leaves
A
When you left
     Em
Your footprints behind
  G         C            D
A hard rain took it from me


    G               D
But baby I’m coming home
      G            C            D       
To my princess, my tower and my throne
Bbmaj7       Am
Sweeping the floor
           Gm7
You’re the one I Adore
Bbmaj7       Am
Yes babe its true
    Gm7
All I want is you
G
Ahhh
