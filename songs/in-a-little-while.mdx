D                  A-G
In a little while
                        D               A-G
When the mountains have turned to sand

D                    A-G
Stay a little while
            A
Your hearts in my hands

D                     A-G
Break a little bread
                     D            A-G
And serve yourself a little wine

  D                A-G
I think the night
            A
Is going to end up fine


G           A
In a little while
D         /C    /B#
You’ll be going home
G           A
In a little while
                   D
You’ll be on your own


Im famished now
I haven’t eaten and its midday

Breaking some eggs
And now we have a little cake


G           A
In a little while
D         /C    /B#
You’ll be going home
G           A
In a little while
                   D   D7
You’ll be on your own

G           A
In a little while
D         /C    /B#
You’ll be going home
G           A
In a little while
                   D
You’ll be on your own
