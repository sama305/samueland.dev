I will always remember this song as the first song I was truly proud of. I don't know why, considering this song is so simple, but I think it was the first song which was stuck in my head. I was amazed I could enjoy my own music so much.

Amaj7 F#m7 Bm7 E E7 x2


Amaj7         F#m7
Woke up on Nantucket
    Bm7          E      E7
The beach I walk along
Amaj7        F#m7
Woke up to a sunrise, yea
Bm7                  E    E7
Clearing through the fog
Amaj7       F#m7
Many people walking
      Bm7           E      E7
along gravel or the docks
    Amaj7       F#m7
And many people talking
   Bm7            E    E7
Of travel and the war


F#m7                  Bm7
Looking for his shiny white back
E                    Amaj7
   Life on a ship it aint too bad
F#m7                  Bm7
   I hope that we may find him
         E
So I can see my little lady
Amaj7
and our cat


I think we’re getting close now
Or so our captain thinks
I’m ready to see you, baby
I wonder how it’ll be
If I get some money
I’ll buy us a place
So we can spend our mornings
Together every day


Looking for his shiny white back
Life on a ship it aint too bad
I hope that we may find him
So I can see my little lady
and our cat


See you through my window
Strolling through the stones
In those moments you don’t feel real
When you’re in those clothes
The sun sets down behind the trees
Darkening the sky
I can hear you coming up now
Your body is near mine


Looking for his shiny white back
Life on a ship it aint too bad
I hope that we may find him
So I can see my little lady
and our cat


Amaj7 F#m7 Bm7 E E7 x2
