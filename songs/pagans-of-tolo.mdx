```
I was walking the road
Looking for somebody I can hold
Seeing your face, you brought me here
I need your heart to be here

Hanging outside with my
Friends around
I just feel myself, like no one arounds
Rooftop views, at the top of stairs

You ask me do I even care
You built it all up, but the frames not around
And now you’ve gone and drove it all to the ground
And looking at me like like ill send hounds
I don’t know what you want but I don’t want to find out

I was going down to the
Riverside
I need a boat and some rope I could find
Looking at the currents going round
I don’t think im getting found out

Trees everywhere
They cover your face
The leaves of decay have now taken your place
You and your boy are coming down
But if you ask me im not hanging round

Get the tinfoil map ahead
The leader has chosen you as their heir instead
You’ve got your books and your papers here
But you don’t even know how to drink a beer
```
