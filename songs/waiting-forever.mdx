This song suffers from a lack of chorus, but I can't seem to find one that fits.

```
             G
I can’t wait forever
        Em
Its too damn long
         F
It’ll be worth it, I know
                G#
But im out here on the lawn

       G
Its so hard to turn away
          Em
From your simple grace
                    F
But im getting so impatient, baby
         G#
Im gonna put you in your place

                     G
Do you know what its like
       Em
To be alone all day
        F
To have no one to talk to
            G#
Or standing in the way

G
You’ve got your little world
       Em
So far away from me
   F
Im resenting it baby
              G#
Im sorry that your so happy
```
