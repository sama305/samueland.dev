G                       C
Round round round robin there she goes
  G                         D
I see, see, see her out the corner of my eyes
  G                           C
I know, know, know that she’s leaving me
      G           D         C     G
But I hope, hope, hope she stays tonight

          G
Well I’ve never seen a woman
C
Sit so beautifully
    G
And she had everyone
       D
In her sweet company
     G
When everybody’s a friend
             C
The truth is nobody is
  G                     D
I hoped she learned her lesson
        C                  G
But she blew me that kiss

Round round round robin there she goes
I see, see, see her out the corner of my eyes
I know, know, know that she’s leaving me
But I hope, hope, hope she stays tonight

Woman oh woman
I thought you were mine
But you give it out to anybody
Who gives you time
I thought that what we had
Nobody could get
But you were giving away
I just didn’t know yet

Round round round robin there she goes
I see, see, see her out the corner of my eyes
I know, know, know that she’s leaving me
But I hope, hope, hope she stays tonight

I hope you leave me
And torture someone else
Maybe we’ll have one last night
But after that, nothing else
You never were so warm
but you knew how to kiss
I hope I never see you again
But who am I kidding?

Round round round robin there she goes
I see, see, see her out the corner of my eyes
I know, know, know that she’s leaving me
But I hope, hope, hope she stays tonight
Yea I hope, hope, hope she stays tonight
Well I know know know she’ll stay tonight
