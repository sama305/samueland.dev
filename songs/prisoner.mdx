     D
Im a prisoner in my mind
      G                         D
I got no say what happens on my time
       D
In the darkness i see it waiting
       G                        D
During boredom, the shadows are playing


        Em7
I can't wait
   D
To get out of here
        Em7
I can't wait
      A
To be free
        D
From my fears

G-D-G

D
Sometimes my limbs just move
        G                            D
And I'm watching, don't know what to do
  D
I want to stop it now
            G                         D
But there's something stopping me somehow


        Em7
I can't wait
   D
To get out of here
        Em7
I can't wait
      A
To be free
        D
From my fears

     D
I've lost all control
G                      D
Nowhere this road will go
     D
It's killing me inside
  G                             D
I wish I could give it one more try

I can't wait
To get out of here
I can't wait
To be free
From my fears
```
