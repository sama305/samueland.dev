D Dmaj7 D6 Dmaj7 x 2

D              Dmaj7           Em7
Under twilight she said yes to me
    A7                              D Dmaj7 D6 Dmaj7
But in the daylight I could clearly see

We weren’t meant to be together baby
But that doesn’t make it hurt any less lately

G                       Bm7
I hope you find someone else
    G
But if you do please just tell me well
C               A
   How good you felt


D Dmaj7 D6 Dmaj7 x 2


When we started we were so young
But we were kids just trying to be playing adults

I miss walking ancient streets with you
And waking to the yellow sunrise too


I hope you find someone else
But if you do please just tell me well
How good you felt


D Dmaj7 D6 Dmaj7 x 2


(instrumental verse)


I hope you find someone else
But if you do please just tell me well
How good you felt

D
