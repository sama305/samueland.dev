## Lyrics and chords

```
G                         Am
There’s no time in this life
    C      D                   G
And nobody knows where they’re going
G                               Am
So you’ve found what you thinks right
    C        D               G
You may just have to keep on looking

              Am      D        G
Cause there’s no easy answers
       /Gb    Em
You’re just a dancer
A7
Dancing each night
       D
Day by day

How does everybody seem to know
What they’re doing and where they’re gonna go
Sitting, thinking there aint enough time
How does everybody spend their lives 

Cause there’s no easy answers
You’re just a dancer
Dancing each night
Day by day

   G                Am
So Feel the rain in stride
    Bm                 Am
And Take the good with pride
G         C         G
   Nobody knows the answers
G         C         G
   Nobody knows the answers

There’s no guide for this life
And nobody knows where they’re going
So if you think that you’ve found what is right
You might just have to keep on looking

Cause there’s no easy answers
You’re just a dancer
Dancing each night
Day by day

Feel the rain in stride
Take the good with pride
Nobody knows the answers
Nobody knows the answers
```
