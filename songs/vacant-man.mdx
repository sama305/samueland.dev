D              E
I was a vacant man
A                     D
Didn’t have much of a plan
D                E
In the light she called me
A          D
Knew I was falling


D E A D - D E A  (repeat after every verse)


It was a simple time
We drank ourselves some wine
Sitting in the cafe
And looking at our eyes


E         A
Oh vacant man
       E                     A
You’ve got no idea of how or when
        G          D           C           A
All you do is step outside and fasten your shoes
    G     D             A
You don’t know anything else to do


I was a vacant man
Didn’t have much of a plan
In the light she called me
Knew I was falling

It was a simple time
We drank ourselves some wine
Sitting in the cafe
And looking at our eyes


Oh vacant man
You’ve got no idea of how or when
All you do is step outside and fasten your shoes
You don’t know anything else to do
