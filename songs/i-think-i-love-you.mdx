A super early but great song I found deep in my voice memos. At the time, I was mostly just recording my covers and some cool guitar licks, so I'm surprised at how good this sounds.

```
Gm7
Everyday we call
       Gm7/F#
And it seems so so long
  Gm7/F                        Gm7/E 
I want to see your face, yes I do


   D3m7
It feels like forever
    Cm7        Cm7/F            Bb
I'm losing you never, i think i love you


No smoke or ale can take my mind
Anywhere but you


I Try to think
Of when we'll meet, I think i love you


Gm7                 Gm7/C
Coffee smell in the morning
C/A              Dm
Sleeping in till noon
      Bb       Bb/C
Those things i miss
     C#
Your special kiss
    Am7
Ooh you


I think I see you now
Across the whole world
I'm holding you close to me


I'll catch if you fall
Don't forget at all
I know I love you
```
