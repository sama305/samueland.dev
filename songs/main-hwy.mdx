Capo 3

C x 2


Walking
A7
Down the road
Dm           G
Down my main highway
C
   Im going
          A7
Where the road don’t snow
Dm          G
   Im going back again


C           E7
Everyone is down again
Am            D
I just got my coat
   C                 G          C
So that old boat has led to you again


I can’t
Realize 
How to swim in the ocean

Im waiting
For your love
To crash me like a potion


You and I are all turned round
I can’t stand the heat
But that old boat has led to you again


Am           G            Am
   I walking on the sea again
   /G  Fmaj7
Nobody can pretend
C              G           Fmaj7         G
   That im not living down beneath them
Am              G              Am
   Well you can save my sailor life
  /G     Fmaj7
I wish I could make you my wife
C                  G    Fmaj7
   And live in the moon forever


Wildly flinging by
Faster than I ever knew
Slipped through like sand on soil
I'm not losing it again


I'm so tired of this old song
I'm just going home

...

But that old boat will lead to you again
