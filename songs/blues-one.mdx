Capo 3rd fret

E  A                           E
   I can’t see you through the fog
A            E
And now it’s dark out
    A      B7     D              A
The purple sky is all that I can see
          E
All I can see


A                 E
It all began as a chase
  A         E
A chase for letters
  A           B7       D          A
A chase which I should never have begun
             E
Never have begun

F#m7                                E
   It’s like climbing up a tree, oh lord
F#m7                   E
   It’s just survival, oh
F#m7   G   A   E
Ooohh


A                       E
Maybe I’ll find you someday
A             E
Laying in the meadow
A             B7          D      A
And you won’t know what’s coming next
              E
What's coming next


A            E
It’ll be the day
A            E
I leave this planet
A        B7       D          A
And god knows I’m taking you with me
           E
Taking you with me


F#m7                                E
   It’s like climbing up a tree, oh lord
F#m7                   E
   It’s just survival, oh
F#m7   G   A   E
Ooohh
