  D                              G
I know something wrong inside, I just don’t know it yet
Em
    So I spend my life trying

And now I look outside when everything is wet
When will I stop crying
 
Yes I know that everything Will turn out right
So why does everything feel so wrong

You and I have been together for a night
But it feels so much longer

C             G
   I know you love me
C                        D
   Well I hope you still do
C                         Gmaj7
   When I get home in the morning
                    D
Im just waiting for you

I know something wrong inside But I don’t know it yet
So I spend my life trying

And now I look outside when everything is wet
When will I stop crying
 
Yes I know that everything Will turn out right
So why does everything feel so wrong

You and I have been together for a night
But it feels so much longer
```
