```
G                    Cmaj7
   Waking on Tuesday night
Am 
   Hoping for a new day
D
Waiting for the sunshine

I rode the ferry late last night
The water rippled and
Moved away from our sides


Bm7            C
   Angel on my sleeve
G
   You know what I really need
D
   You know what I really need
Bm7             C
   Angle on the breeze
Am
Breath right into me
D
Breath right into me

Waiting for a good time
Working to live for today
Waiting for a change of some kind

I rode the ferry late last night
The water rippled and
Moved away from our sides

Angel on my sleeve
You know what I really need
You know what I really need
Angle on the breeze
Breath right into me
Breath right into me

Angel on my sleeve
You know what I really need
You know what I really need
Angle on the breeze
Breath right into me
Breath right into me
```
