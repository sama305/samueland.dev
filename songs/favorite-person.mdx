Cadd9: x32030

D                   G         Cadd9      D
I was hugged by the cool cool darkness
                           Cadd9 G
Underneath the blankets of my bedroom

You looked so pretty in the morning
Your skin was pink as a coral cloud


A                        D
I was told that you were certain
A                       G     A
I made some plans which can’t proceed 
D   A   G               A
You are my ... favorite person

We saw some colors which can’t be seen
In the nova behind our eyes

I miss just sitting and sleeping with you
In the simplest of times

I was told that you were certain
I made some plans which can’t proceeded 
You are my favorite person

```
