```
Cmaj7         Dsus2
   Wandering alone
     Am
Do I settle down?
   C                B7
Or call the land my home?

Moments disappear
When you went away
Shattered my life in two

E             Emaj7
   Before and after you
A
   That’s where my life will end
E          A
I can’t pretend
E                    A
   You’re my special lady friend
E               F#m7
I wish we could mend
    G#m7                 Am7    E
And try this whole thing again


How can I go on
When my partners gone
Taken by the waves of time

It was so good for so long
wasn’t meant to last
wish I could’ve known in the past


(instrumental verse)


Before and after your
That’s where my life will end
I can’t pretendp
You’re my special lady friend
I wish we could mend
And try this whole thing again
```
