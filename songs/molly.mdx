Originally, I was trying to make a nice, tweed sounding love song. Early on, I realized the lyrics came across creepy, but I just ran with it. Here's a creepy stalker song about a guy obsessed with a girl name Molly.

```
D
Molly
A
Hey there
G
Its been a long long time

D
   How you doin
A              G
   What’s goin on
In your life

Bm
   I can’t remember
      G
Why I made you so sad
Bm
   I can’t remember
       G           D
Why it ended up so bad


Molly
Why don’t
We get lunch sometime

If you're busy
Don’t worry, I can wait a while


I can’t remember
Why I made you so sad
I can’t remember
Why it ended up so bad


Molly
Where are
You living at these days

Im just asking
I don’t live there anyways


I can’t remember
Why I made you so sad
I can’t remember
Why it ended up so bad


Molly
Please don’t
Run and hide

I didn’t mean to scare you
I was just trying to provide


I can’t remember
Why I made you so sad
I can’t remember
Why it ended up so bad


Molly
I can’t
See you in the dark

But I hope you know
That youre always in my 


I can’t remember
Why I made you so sad
I can’t remember
Why it ended up so bad


Molly
I think
Im going down for good

I just hope you know
That I loved you as I should


Though you managed
To put me in the ground
You won’t be free from me
Until im lost and found
G                    D
   Until im lost and found
```
