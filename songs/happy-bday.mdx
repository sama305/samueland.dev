Am       G                Fmaj7    G
   Happy birthday to you, my love
Am      G                 Fmaj7    G
   It’s been such a  long time
Am           G       Fmaj7             G
   Since the days of wandering fields
Am             G            Fmaj7         G
   My feelings grow, if you give it time


C
   Lets go out
F
   Dance together
C                  F
   You will always be my girl
Am
   Show me round
Em
   As your lover
F                           G
   I care about you like no other


Good morning to you, my dear
I’ll meet you in the Marabar hills
Stones and thumbs can barely hold it all
Can only hold the feelings that I feel


Lets go out
Dance together
You will always be my girl
So don’t forget
On your special day
I care bout you in many different ways
I care bout you in many different ways
```
