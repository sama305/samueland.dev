Amaj7  F#m7  Bm           E
   Our love, put together like it’s always been
Amaj7 F#m7     Bm          E
   Tonight, so special are stars which come alive
F#m7     Bm7    E    Amaj7
   Every night
F#m7     Bm7    E    Amaj7
   Every night


Our   time, plowed quite nicely out in the village green
In time, we’ll spend each moment counting harmony
Every night
Every night


A              Bm   Dm7
   Valentine’s Day
                Bm
I hope it never ends
   A                Bm         Dm7
To me it’s like any other day
                     Bm     A x 2
But like any day its all pretend


Once I had left I had never so many pains
And I wish there was a way to start again
Every night
Every night


Goodbye, you said my name one final time
But in time, I'll see you in my heart in secret wish
Every night
Every night
Every night
Every night
```
