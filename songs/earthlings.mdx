```
They came with optimism
And left the world imprisoned
Jumping like snappers in the wind

Ideas have remainders
And quotients left containers
Were all just numbers and statistics

You and I are less than dirt to them
An eye for an eye is not the plan
But when you treat us like were in a pen
We’ve got no reason to pretend

Were living in the New Age
But seeing through the Stone Age
Were no better than before

We gave up all our suffrage
And rolled into the luxuries
Of modern human capital today

We all see visions of the death of man
Its not just me, you can ask anyone
Cause when you treat us like were in a pen
We’ve got no reason to pretend

I don’t discount the wonders
But We all suffer the blunders
Of humankind’s exit from the earth

I just hope we can realize
The stars and answers in our eyes
Our destinies await us on the ground

We aren’t meant to live again
The Rules of life aren’t meant to bend
And when you treat us like were in a pen
We’ve got no reason to pretend
```
