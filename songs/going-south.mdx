   E-A-D-G-B-e
D9 X-5-4-5-3-0


A D9 x 2

A
I’ve been going south for
F
   Six long years
A
   You don’t got nothing
D9
   Against my tears

Everybody’s coming out from L.A.
Don’t you know you’ve got
No reason to be that way

A        D9    A
Im going south
              D9  G
Im going real far away

A        D9     A
Im going south
              D9      G
I don’t which kind of way


When I knew her smile
Was many years ago
She had roses on her temple
Like the whitest snow

But like it always does
Something gave out
I thought I did my best
But I was received by a shout


Im going south
Im going real far away

Im going south
I don’t which kind of way


A D9 G x 2

(repeat these chords for the bridge below
 while speaking in a normal tone)

Going south
Is what I like to do
Id like to that way
Very much with you
If you’d take my hand
Well be on our way
In fact if you pack we can leave today


Im going south
Im going real far away

Im going south
I don’t which kind of way


Im going south
Im going real far away

Im going south
I don’t which kind of way
```
