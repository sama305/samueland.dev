E               Emaj7      F#m7
   I don't know why I ever met you
E              Emaj7        F#m7 D9
   And I don't know whoever sent you
But where you come from I come from
Love is found in every person.

A               G#m7
   I just wanna feel so real
F#m7                G#m7
   Running down the streets with you
A               G#m7         F#m7    E
   Every single momenet now, beside you

A               G#m7
   I can really feel it now
F#m7              G#m7
   I can see your sex appeal
A               G#m7         F#7            B    /A  /G#  /F#  E
   Every single momenet now, living with no fear


It all was on me like an anvil
Crushed me all down the mantle
But you arrived just like a feather
And you put me back together


I just wanna feel so real
Running down the streets with you
Every single momenet now, beside you

I can really feel it now
I can see your sex appeal
Every single momenet now, all i can hear

I can really feel it now
I can see your sex appeal
Every single momenet now, all i can hear
