```
C                       Fmaj7
   Sitting underneath a hanging tree
Am              G               D7
   With all its shadows hanging under me

Think of all the people it can possibly be
There’s so many possibilities

Living for freedom and for life to be true
What else can a man possibly do

Feet dangling, shadows on plaza floor
What good of any is this killing for


   F    G   C    Cmaj7
My lover is free
F                 G               C
   She’s Creeping up and down the city
F   G        Am                D
Shadows show me what I want to see
                  G  G7
And all I want to be


Sitting underneath a hanging tree
With all its shadows hanging under me

Think of all the people it can possibly be
There’s so many possibilities


My lover is free
She’s Creeping up and down the city
Shadows show me what I want to see
And all I want to be
