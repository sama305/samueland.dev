Dmaj7 Gmaj7 x 4

Dmaj7         Gmaj7
   It was the truth I 
Dmaj7          Gmaj7
   was buzzing back

Dmaj7       Gmaj7
   And everybody’s
Dmaj7        Gmaj7
   Beyond compare


G
   I never wanted
              Dmaj7 Gmaj7 x 2
To wait 4 long years
G
   And all people went around me
                     Dmaj7 Gmaj7 x 2
Listening with their ears

      G
But I don’t know
    Bm7
How long
      G
But I don’t know
                E     A /G
If I was really wrong 


I want peace now
Real far away

And you can have the same
If you can pay


It was all too much
For too many years

I hope Ive learned a lot
From the tears  
```
