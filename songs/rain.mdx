     E-A-D-G-B-E
Bm*  x-0-4-0-3-0

Am          Bm*
I have come    but I have disappeared
  Am          Bm*
Into the mist   from where the rain appeared
Am                         Bm*
Thousands of droplets came    showering down
C                  D       Am
When everybody had already left the town


C                D        Am
  Yes, Rain will come and rain will go
     C         D         Am
So remember to pack your rainbow


    Am                      Bm*
The morning was long but so    was the night
       Am                   Bm*
In the blackness of shadows    there was lamplight
  Am             Bm*
A lone old angel    walks on down the stairs
C               D               Am
Knowing what he needs, a golden key appears


C                D        Am
  Yes, Rain will come and rain will go
     C         D         Am
So remember to pack your rainbow


A                  Dmaj7
Rain, rain.. oh my
A                       Dmaj7
I want to… feel alive
Bb           A
   Under the moonlight
Bb              A
   I can hardly see
Gm7               A
Hunting, Watching... 


Careless lies have all gone mad for blood
And the buckets are all overflowing with serpent ,mud
The whispers and wanderers take care the knight
Settling in their castles with their Spanish knights


C                D        Am
  Yes, Rain will come and rain will go
     C         D         Am
So remember to pack your rainbow


A                  Dmaj7
Rain, rain.. oh my
A                       Dmaj7
I want to… feel alive
Bb           A
   Under the moonlight
Bb              A
   I can hardly see
Gm7               A
Hunting, Watching...
