Inspired by *The Plague* (1947) by Albert Camus, which I made a [blog post review for](/blog/2026-01-12-the-plague-review).

```
Am Gma7 Dm C x 2

Am       Gmaj7          Dm          C
   I was talking in the early dawn, awake
Am            Gmaj7          Dm    C
   He started coughing out a black apology
Am           Gmaj7          Dm             C
   Bodies in piles down the street I smell it now
Am           Gmaj7             Dm         C
   This pestilence is going to kill me anyhow

Am Gma7 Dm C x 2

Doctors are rushing to every patient in town
There’s no time or meaning to anything anyhow
All across I hear the murmur of the plague
I think I might get it soon but there’s no saying 

If I get ill be fine
But I think im getting weaker
Line by line

I see a light which lies just beyond the clouds
Its so faint but I can hear In the crowds

Nobody knows if this will ever end
Do what you can and save as many men 

If I get ill be fine
But I think im getting weaker
Line by line
```
