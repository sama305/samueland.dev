Capo 3rd fret

                            F#m7  B7
And though I love you so my dear
                  Emaj7
I love you in the sunshine
                            F#m7  B7
My love for you will always grow
                     Emaj7
As long as you’ll be mine
                            F#m7  B7
Remember when we first were here
                      Emaj7
It seemed like such a long time
                          F#m7  Am7
And now well grow so very old
                     Emaj7
In our little home together

A    E
Just my
B  E
Surprise
A   E
You find
B  E
My time
A E
I won’t
B  E
No lie
F#m7   B7
I love you


                             F#m7  B7
There are no word for you my dear
                  Emaj7
You are my little sunshine
                               F#m7  B7
And so those words you long to hear
                      Emaj7
I'll give them to you all the time
                         F#m7  B7
Our love has only just begun
                   Emaj7
The beginning of forever
                        F#m7  G#m7
Countless days to come along
               Emaj7
To show all my loving

F#m7   B7
I love you


                          F#m7  B7
And so this song may soon end
                      Emaj7
My love for you never will
                      F#m7  B7
Every single day is a joy
             Emaj7    E7
It’s a great mystery


       F#m7                B7
How we found each other at all
    G#m7            E
Our love must never fall
    F#m7            G#m7             B7      E
And so it ends this song but not our love at all
