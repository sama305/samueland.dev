With this song, you should try to arpeggiate through the first three strings when you play the main `Em` parts.

```
Em
Traveling man
                  Cmaj7  Em
Are you weary for me-e-e-e

Traveling man
                        Cmaj7 Em
Will you sit here with me-e-e-e

         Am
When you travel long
        C
And you brace for dark
         Em
When the story falls

         Am
When you wake at night
        Bm
And you feel so right
         Em
Will you walk with me?


Traveling man
From your traveling times
Traveling man
Are you weary for me-e-e-e


Am                  C
From your traveling times
                  Em
The songs and the rhymes
Am
You’re well read but its
C                       Em
all in your head, is it now

Am
Then youre gone
Bm7
Yeah youre gone
       C                  D
You’re down at the sacred mound

Em
Oohh
```
