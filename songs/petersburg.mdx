Dm7
3 o clock
Dm7
St. Petersburg
Dm7
Train is here
Dm7                Gmaj7
And snow is coming soon

Dm7
The frigid air
Dm7
Bites my lips
Dm7
It's burning now
Dm7               Gmaj7
And reminds me of you


Fmaj7                            Cmaj7
   I'm crazy, living out in this cold
Gmaj7                          Fma7
   The sun is sinking and I'm just getting old
Fmaj7-Cmaj7
Ooh


Dm7
I'm right outside
Dm7
I see your face
Dm7
In the window pane
Dm7             Gmaj7
Staring down at me

Dm7
I feel your words
Dm7
They hit me hard
Dm7
I turn around
Dm7                    Gmaj7
But I know you want me here


Fmaj7                            Cmaj7
   I'm crazy, living out in this cold
Gmaj7                          Fma7
   The sun is sinking and I'm just getting old
Fmaj7-Cmaj7
Ooh


Am        G            F     G
   I’m so tired of the snow
Am        G             F
   I'm so tired of this ice
Am         G            F      Cmaj7
   It’s so draining the cold,


Dm7
The warmth in here
Dm7
Is greater than
Dm7
The temperature
Dm7                   Gmaj7
On the surface of the sun

Dm7
I close my eyes
Dm7
And squeeze you hard
Dm7
Knowing well
Dm7               Gmaj7
Our love is never done


Fmaj7                            Cmaj7
   I'm crazy, living out in this cold
Gmaj7                          Fma7
   The sun is sinking and I'm just getting old
Fmaj7-Cmaj7
Ooh
