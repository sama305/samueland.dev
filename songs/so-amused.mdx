   When you
C#m7
   Call me
A     B7
   At night
E
   I know
C#m7      A
   What I wanna be

I can’t
Pretend
Any longer
What you
Mean to me

Call me
By my
New name
While we
Walk along the road

When I
Look at
Your pretty eyes
I think
I might explode


C#m
   I just want to
C
   Be with you
E          A
   But its hurting me
E            A
   Yeah, Its hurting me
C#m
   Can I hear your voice
C           B7
   Before I snooze


When you
Call me
At night
I know
What I wanna be

I can’t
Pretend
Any longer
What you
Mean to me


I just want to
Be with you
But its hurting me
Yeah, Its hurting me
Can I hear your voice
Before I snooze
```
