```
G                     C            G
I thought things were in the right direction
G          C                     D
You never said that anything was wrong


   G              C
Or maybe I wasn’t listening
      G                C
I was too busy playing guessing
    G       C        D           G
But I never meant to hurt you at all


Those years ago, I felt so glad
But now all those memories just make me sad


You asked me to dance
And I thought I took your hand
But it’s so hard to dance without knowing at all

Em                 Am
I want to make you mine
    D                     Em
But I know you won’t come home
    G          Am
And I, feel so alive
  D                       G
I just don't know what to do


I hope I learn something from these songs
And maybe I’ll won’t feel bad for long

I hope I don’t forget you
And all the things that you do
I know I can’t forget you at all
```
