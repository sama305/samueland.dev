As my final semester of university comes to a close, the daunting reality of the job search is starting to take hold. It feels like you're trying to feel your way around a dark, empty forest in the middle of the night with nothing to guide you except the occasional ominous snap of a twig in the distance. It's a painful and excruciating band-aid we all have to rip off at some point, and the best we can do for ourselves is try to make ourselves comfortable.

In this article, I'm going to discuss the strategies I've been experimenting with to try to lighten both the job search and potential interviews. I don't claim to be knowledgable of the job search; I don't even claim any of these are greatly original; but in a year's time, when hopefully my search will have produced *something*, and I'd like to look back at this to see what worked and what didn't.

## Crafting a résumé

Among the most elemental components of someone's employment profile is the résumé (yes, it's actually spelled like [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9)). I don't think you, the reader, are stupid of course, so I'm not going to explain what it is, but I do want to talk about certain deliberate decisions I made when drafting it so I have a better idea when looking back at it.

One of the most important aspects of my résumé was containing it within a single page. If I had more experience, I'd probably break this rule, but out of college with little experience, a single-page résumé feels terse and approachable. At the same time, I think it's important to use as much of the single page as possible.

I opine that a résumé serves two purposes: firstly, linguistically communicating your experience and skills; secondly, visually communicating your attention to detail and ability to work within limitations. In this way, a résumé is more than just a document: it's a tangible representation of your problem-solving skills.

### Cover letter or no cover letter?

A document which is commonly grouped with the résumé is the cover letter. A common question which I and many others have asked whether or not to include this cover letter in applications. To me, it seems an antiquated artifact of a time where each job a person applied to was far more meaningful, but what is its place in the modern job search? The answer: nobody knows.

In almost all cases, the moment you submit your application for a job, your role in the review process has ended. It's now up to whoever is lucky (or unlucky) enough to recieve this document on their desk (or, far more likely, within some dedicated hiring application). This person may or may not like cover letters; they may or may not like images in a résumé; this person may have a deep and irrational hatred for someone with your name; they may have spilled coffee on their lap just before reading your application and thus already have a lower chance of accepting you.

My point is that there are so many variables which can't be controlled, so it's best to just try different things in the hope that the stars may align and the person who receives your application actually loves your name, went to the same university as you, and just *adores* the font you chose for your cover letter. I include a cover letter because there's nearly no downside in doing so, but try different approaches and see what works for you.

## Where to apply

My methodology with where to apply is quite simple: I look on Indeed or LinkedIn (most the former) for jobs which *roughly* match my skills/experience and immediately check the company website for an application form. If they have one, great: apply through the company website. If not, just apply through which ever employment site you found it on. Rinse and repeat.

If you are able to contact the hiring manager, or if you perhaps have some sort of connection, this is great and you should pursue them; all the while, apply for every job which even remotely overlaps with your abilities.

## Staying in practice

In Spanish, the reflexive verb *informarse* means to keep oneself informed. This is a practice which should always be occuring in the background of near constant job searching and applications. It's for this reason I've integrated practicing coding problems with [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) in my daily routine.

While I hate that it's the standard, there is value in knowing how to utilize and apply the elemental data structures of computer science. I'm not the biggest fan of the fact that it has become the de facto way to cull applicants, though [this may be changing](https://startupspells.com/p/leetcode-marketing-stunt-viral-interview-coder). For now, however, we live in a reality where it's better to Leetcode than not, and I do genuinly feel like my understanding of data structures has improved since I started using it about a week ago.

### Keep it personal
More importantly than practicing Leetcode should be the development of personal projects. Besides being more meaningful and far less boring to work on, you actually learn the same coding paradigms in a more practical, natural way. Still, it doesn't hurt to practice in between these portfolio boosters, and you'll be glad you did if the interviewer asks you to implement a merge sort algorithm in C++!

## Documenting your progress

My most recent addition to my job search strategy can be seen right in front of you: documenting the whole process. Besides the fact that writing is an extremely valuable skill to maintain, writing also allows you to cache your current thoughts and reread them under a new context at a later time. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is walk away from something and come back later with a fresh lens. If you write down your thoughts, then the something in this case is an *idea*. It's an invaluable tool to have and one that will help you be a little less blind when trying out new things; you now have the benefit of past experiences at your disposal.

Besides straight-up writing, I've also started tracking my progress on a Google Sheets document. Every job has the date I applied, its name, the role, the pay, and other related metrics. This allows me to quantify my search and hopefully gain more "scientific" insight into my progress.
